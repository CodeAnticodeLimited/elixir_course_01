# Elixir course

This will be a gentle introduction to Elixir. It assumes no previous experience with the language, however I _will_ assume that you have a reasonable level of experience with at least one other programming language and basic programming concepts.

The first few workshops will focus on gently introducing you to the language through simple excercises inspired largely by [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). By the end of each workshop, you will have the skills and knowledge to tackle one or more Advent of Code challenges in Elixir. We focus specifically on skills to solve the first few challenges in [Advent of Code 2017 edition](https://adventofcode.com/2017)

## What you will learn

By the end of these introductory workshops you will be familiar with:

- basic Elixir syntax
- the difference between .ex and .exs files
- compiling and running Elixir code
- using `iex` for interactively developing in Elixir
- basic data types in Elixir such as atoms, lists and maps
- how Elixir code is structured using modules and functions
- approaching solutions as a series of data transformations
- how pattern matching works and why it is so powerful
- 'functional' approaches to working with lists

Although not explicitly covered in the workshop, the provided sample code also demonstrates:

- writing tests with ExUnit
- structuring an Elixir project to use with `mix`
